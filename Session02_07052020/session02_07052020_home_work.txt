Pure Date:

1. Create a PD-Patch and build a simple FM Synthesis

C-coding:

16: Implement the function "what_to_do" with if-statements only.


17: Move the variable j to the file 17_StaticExternGlobalVar.c and access it in main.c with the keyword extern.


18: Write thePermanentHeap() function with pointer arithmetic instead of the array index access method:      *aHeapPointer++ = i;
    In the main function print out all values instead of the index 4 only. Be careful what you return in thePermanentHeap() function!


19: Write a function that allocates memory for
// integers with calloc and returns the allocated
// memory as an int pointer.
// The function should have two int arguments:
// the number of integers to allocate, and a
// default value. Every int field of the allocated memory
// should be initialized with this default value.
// call this function from main instead of calling calloc
// directly.

(The numbers correspond to the C files in this git and our repl.it)
